          Beautifully lush and forested, ensconced in the mountain ranges of
          Sorsogon facing the Pacific, and best of all, dayhikable from Legazpi
          City, <b>Mt. Pulog</b> in the municipality of Bacon is one of Bicol’s
          best-kept hiking secrets. It is, of course, not to be mistaken with
          Mt. Pulag, the famous highest mountain in Luzon, which is also
          sometimes pronounced Pulog, and therefore spelled as such. Mt. Pulog
          is one of several dayhikes that can be staged from Legazpi City. In
          April 2011, Iron Lady Jo Steven and I dayhiked six mountains in one
          week, all staged from Legazpi: Asog, Malinao, Masaraga, Mayon (yes, it
          can be dayhiked via the New Trail), Binanderahan in Rapu-Rapu, and
          Pulog. You just have to take an early morning bus to Sorsogon City,
          and from there, take a jeepney to Bacon and ask to be dropped off at
          Brgy. Sta. Cruz, where you can get a guide. At first, you walk through
          rural woodlands where abaca and pili are common sights; ask your guide
          if the native, sour fruit called hagis is in season – it is a nice
          trail food! After 1-1.5 hours, you will be in the Campsite, which
          offers good views of the Pacific ocean and of the town of Bacon. This
          is the halfway point in the trail. Past this wide campsite, the trail
          gets steeper, and you begin to enter a forest reminscent of Mt.
          Cristobal and somewhat of Mt. Makiling. After another 1-1.5 hours, you
          will emerge from the forest into a “cogonal field” that is again
          reminiscent of Jones’ Peak in Mt. Cristobal or the summit of Mt. Iraya
          in Batanes. From here, you can see beautiful views of the outlying
          towns. However, the main attraction at the summit (babaw) is Pulog
          lake (danum); since both are called Pulog, it is useful to refer to
          them with the bracketed terms. It is almost perfectly round, and a
          traverse going to the lake is very possible – and manageable within a
          dayhike, especially if the weather is good. This traverse will
          eventually end up in the adjacent Brgy. San Juan. Mt. Pulog is really
          a nice dayhike in the Bicol Region – and if you have time to spare,
          spending a night at the Campsite is also a good idea. Considering the
          volatility of the other hiking attraction in Sorsogon – Bulusan
          Volcano – Mt. Pulog is also a good fallback in case you cannot climb
          it. Hence, it is good to have Mt. Pulog in mind whenever you
          contemplate going to Bicol for some hiking.
